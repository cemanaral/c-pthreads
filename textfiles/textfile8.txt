  
something.

  
If you are hungry,
go up and look around, Remy.

  
Why do you wait and mope?

  
Well, I've just lost my family,
all my friends,

  
probably forever.

  
- How do you know?
- Well, I...

  
You are an illustration.
Why am I talking to you?

  
Well, you just lost your family,
all your friends. You are lonely.

  
Yeah. Well, you're dead.

  
Ah, but that is no match
for wishful thinking.

  
If you focus on what you've left behind,

  
you'll never be able to see
what lies ahead.

  
Now go up and look around.

  
Champagne!

  
What are you doing?

  
I'm hungry.

  
I don't know where I am,

  
and I don't know
when I'll find food again.

  
Remy, you are better than that.
You are a cook.

  
A cook makes. A thief takes.
You are not a thief.

  
But I am hungry.

  
Food will come, Remy.

  
Food always comes
to those who love to cook.

  
- You think I am playing?
- You don't have the guts.

  
Paris?

  
All this time
I've been underneath Paris?

  
Wow.

  
It's beautiful.

  
The most beautiful.

  
Gusteau's? Your restaurant?

  
You've led me to your restaurant.

  
It seems as though I have. Yes.
There it is! I have led you to it!

  
I got to see this.

  
Ready to go on table seven.
Coming around.

  
One order of steamed pike up.
Coming up.

  
I need
more soup bowls, please.

  
I need two rack of lamb.
I need more leeks.
