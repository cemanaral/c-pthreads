What I say is true. Anyone can cook.
But only the fearless can be great.

  
Pure poetry.

  
But it was not to last.

  
Gusteau's restaurant lost
one of its five stars

  
after a scathing review
by France's top food critic, Anton Ego.

  
It was a severe blow to Gusteau,

  
and the brokenhearted chef
died shortly afterwards,

  
which, according to tradition,
meant the loss of another star.

  
Gusteau is dead?

  
Run!

  
No, you'll lead her to the colony!

  
- Help, Remy, help!
- Emile! Start swinging the light!

  
- Help, Remy, help!
- Emile! Start swinging the light!

  
Try to grab you.

  
Emile, swing to me.

  
Evacuate! Everyone, to the boats.

  
Let me through!
- The book.

  
Let me through!
- The book.

  
Excuse me. Move, move.

  
Go, go, go, go. Move, move, move.

  
Get the bridge up! Move it, move it!

  
Hey, Johnny! Hurry!

  
Push off. Come on.

  
Get hold!

  
- Take the baby. Here!
- Give me your paw.

  
Hey, wait for me!

  
Is everybody here?
Do we have everybody?

  
- Wait a minute. Where's Remy?
- Right here. I'm coming.

  
I'm coming!

  
Hold on, Son.
Give him something to grab on to.

  
Come on, boy. Paddle, Son.

  
Come on. Reach for it.

  
You can do it.

  
- Remy!
- Dad!

  
Come on. You can make it.
You can make it.

  
Guys, wait. Stop!

  
Remy. Come on. Paddle.

  
Hold on! Wait for me. Hold on.

  
Dad?

  
Dad?

  
Which way?

  
I waited

  
for a sound,

  
a voice,

  
a sign,
