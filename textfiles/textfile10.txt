  
Any son of Renata's is more than...

  
Yes, well, we could file this
and if something suitable opens up...

  
We have already hired him.

  
What? How dare you hire someone
without my...

  
We needed a garbage boy.

  
Oh, garbage. Well...

  
I'm glad it worked out.

  
I can't believe it.

  
A real gourmet kitchen,
and I get to watch.

  
You've read my book.
Let us see how much you know, huh?

  
Which one is the chef?

  
- Oh, that guy.
- Very good.

  
Who is next in command?

  
The sous chef. There.

  
The sous is responsible for the kitchen
when the chef's not around.

  
Saucier, in charge of sauces.
Very important.

  
Chef de partie, demi chef de partie,
both important.

  
Commis, commis, they're cooks.
Very important.

  
You are a clever rat. Now, who is that?

  
Oh, him? He's nobody.

  
Not nobody. He is part of the kitchen.

  
No, he's a plongeur or something.

  
He washes dishes or takes out
the garbage. He doesn't cook.

  
- But he could.
- Uh, no.

  
How do you know?
What do I always say?

  
Anyone can cook.

  
Well, yeah, anyone can.
That doesn't mean that anyone should.

  
Well,
that is not stopping him. See?

  
What is he doing?
No. No! No, this is terrible!

  
He's ruining the soup.
And nobody's noticing?

  
It's your restaurant. Do something.

  
What can I do?
I am a figment of your imagination.

  
But he's ruining the soup!
We got to tell someone that he's...

  
But he's ruining the soup!
We got to tell someone that he's...

  
Table five coming up,
right now.

  
Coming down the line.
Set.

  
Hot! Open oven!

  
Coming around.

  
Oui, chef.
One filet mignon, three lamb, two duck.

  
Fire those souffl√©s
for table six, ja.

  
Five minutes, chef.
- Oh, God.

  
Tonight,
I'd like to present the foie gras.

  
It has a wonderful finish.

  
Ready to go on table seven.
Come on! Let's go!

  
Oui, chef.

  
Remy! What are you waiting for?

  
Is this going to become a regular thing
with you?

  
You know how to fix it.
This is your chance.

  
The soup! Where is the soup?
Out of my way.

  
Move it, garbage boy!

  
You are cooking?

  
How dare you cook in my kitchen?

  
Where do you get the gall
