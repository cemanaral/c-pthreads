First of all, I'm a rat.

  
Which means life is hard.

  
And second, I have a highly developed
sense of taste and smell.

  
Flour, eggs, sugar, vanilla bean...

  
Oh! Small twist of lemon.

  
Whoa, you can smell all that?
You have a gift.

  
This is Emile, my brother.
He's easily impressed.

  
So you can smell ingredients?
So what?

  
This is my dad. He's never impressed.

  
He also happens to be
the leader of our clan.

  
So, what's wrong
with having highly developed senses?

  
- Don't eat that!
- What's going on here?

  
Turns out that funny smell
was rat poison.

  
Suddenly, Dad didn't think
my talent was useless.

  
I was feeling pretty good about my gift,

  
until Dad gave me a job.

  
Clean.

  
Clean.

  
That's right. Poison checker.

  
Cleanerific.

  
Cleanerino.

  
Close to godliness.
