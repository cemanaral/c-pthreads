Ratatouille Script

  
  
Although each of the world's countries

  
would like to dispute this fact,

  
we French know the truth:

  
The best food in the world
is made in France.

  
The best food in France
is made in Paris.

  
And the best food in Paris, some say,
is made by Chef Auguste Gusteau.

  
Gusteau's restaurant
is the toast of Paris,

  
booked five months in advance.

  
And his dazzling ascent
to the top of fine French cuisine

  
has made his competitors envious.

  
He is the youngest chef ever
to achieve a five-star rating.

  
Chef Gusteau's cookbook,
Anyone Can Cook!

  
Climbed to the top of the bestseller list.

  
But not everyone
celebrates its success.

  
Amusing title, Anyone Can Cook!

  
What's even more amusing is that
Gusteau actually seems to believe it.

  
I, on the other hand,
take cooking seriously.

  
And, no, I don't think anyone can do it.

  
This is me.

  
I think it's apparent
I need to rethink my life a little bit.

  
What's my problem?
