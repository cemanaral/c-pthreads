Hello, Chef Skinner.
How your night be now?

  
Bonjour, chef.
Hello, Chef Skinner.

  
- Evening, chef.
Ordering deux filet.

  
Hey, boss, look who is here.

  
Alfredo Linguini, Renata's little boy.

  
- Hi.
- All grown up, eh?

  
You remember Renata,
Gusteau's old flame?

  
- Yes. How are you...
- Linguini.

  
Yes, Linguini. So nice of you to visit.
How is...

  
- My mother?
- Renata.

  
- Yes, Renata. How is she?
- Good.

  
Well, not... She's been better. I mean...

  
She died.

  
I'm sorry.

  
Oh, don't be. She believed in heaven,
so she's covered.

  
You know, afterlife-wise?

  
- What's this?
- She left it for you.

  
I think she hoped it would help me,
