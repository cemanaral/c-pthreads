he's not going to like it.

  
What have you got there?

  
You found cheese?

  
And not just any cheese.
Tomme de ch√®vre de pays!

  
That would go beautifully
with my mushroom.

  
And...

  
This rosemary! This rosemary

  
with maybe with a few drops
from this sweet grass.

  
Well, throw it on the pile, I guess,
and then we'll... You know...

  
We don't want to throw this in
with the garbage. This is special.

  
But we're supposed
to return to the colony

  
before sundown or,
you know, Dad's gonna...

  
Emile!

  
There are possibilities
unexplored here.

  
We got to cook this.

  
Now, exactly how we cook this
is the real question...

  
Yeah.

  
The key is to keep turning it.

  
Get the smoky flavor nice and even.

  
That storm's getting closer.

  
Hey, Remy, you think that maybe

You got to taste this!

It's a certain... It's kind of like a...

  
It's got, like, this "ba-boom, zap"
kind of taste. Don't you think?

  
- What would you call that flavor?
- Lightning-y?

  
Yeah. It's lightning-y!
We got to do that again.

  
Okay, when the next storm comes,
we'll go up on the roof...
