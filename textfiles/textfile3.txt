Which means clean.
You know, cleanliness is close to...

  
Never mind. Move on.

  
Well, it made my dad proud.

  
Now, don't you feel better, Remy?
You've helped a noble cause.

  
Noble? We're thieves, Dad.

  
And what we're stealing is,
let's face it, garbage.

  
It isn't stealing if no one wants it.

  
If no one wants it,
why are we stealing it?

  
Let's just say
we have different points of view.

  
This much I knew:

  
If you are what you eat,
then I only want to eat the good stuff.

  
But to my dad...

  
Food is fuel.

  
You get picky about what you put
in the tank, your engine is gonna die.

  
Now shut up and eat your garbage.

  
Look, if we're going to be thieves,

  
why not steal the good stuff
in the kitchen,

  
where nothing is poisoned?

  
First of all, we are not thieves.

  
Secondly, stay out of the kitchen
and away from the humans.

  
It's dangerous.

  
I know
I'm supposed to hate humans,

  
but there's something about them.
