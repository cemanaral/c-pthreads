I know what this needs! Saffron!
A little saffron would make this!

  
Saffron. Why do I get the feeling

  
- it's in the kitchen?
- It's in the kitchen.

  
Saffron.
- Not good.

  
Saffron.

  
Don't like it. She's gonna wake up.

  
I've been down here a million times.

  
She turns on the cooking channel,
boom, she never wakes up.

  
You've been here a million times?

  
I'm telling you, saffron will be
just the thing. Gusteau swears by it.

  
Okay. Who's Gusteau?

  
Just the greatest chef in the world.
Wrote this cookbook.

  
Wait. You read?

  
- Well, not excessively.
- Oh, man. Does Dad know?

  
You could fill a book, a lot
of books, with things Dad doesn't know.

  
And they have, which is why I read.
Which is also our secret.

  
I don't like secrets.

  
All this cooking
and reading and TV-watching

  
while we read and cook.

  
It's like you're involving me in crime,
and I let you.

  
Why do I let you?

  
What's taking those kids so long?

  
Ah, I'Aquila saffron. Italian. Huh?

  
Gusteau says it's excellent.
Good thing the old lady is a food love...

  
Forget mystique.
This is about your cooking.

  
Hey! That's Gusteau. Emile, look.

  
Great cooking
is not for the faint of heart.

  
Great cooking
is not for the faint of heart.

  
You must be imaginative,
strong hearted.

  
You must try things that may not work.

  
And you must not let anyone
define your limits

  
because of where you come from.

  
Your only limit is your soul.
