And
second
I
have
a

Oh
Small

Whoa
you
can
smell
all
that
You
have
a
gift
This
is
Emile
my
brother
He's
easily
impressed
So
you
can
smell
ingredients
So
what
This
is
my
dad
He's
never
doubled array elements size to 128
impressed
He
also
happens
to
be
the
leader
of
our
clan
So
what's
wrong
with
having
highly
developed
senses
Don't
eat
that
What's
going
on
here
Turns
out
that
funny
smell
was
rat
poison
Suddenly
Dad
didn't
think
my
talent
was
useless
I
was
feeling
pretty
good
about
my
gift
until
Dad
gave
me

Oh

Well
I'm
glad
it
worked
out
I
can't
believe
it
A
real

kitchen
and
I
get
to
watch
You've
read
my
book
Let
us
see
how
much
you
know
huh
Which
one
is
the
chef
Oh

guy
Very
good
Who

The

a

Now
who
is
that
Oh
him
He's
nobody
Not
nobody
He
is
part
of
the
kitchen
No
he's
a
plongeur
or
something
He
washes
dishes
or
takes
out
the
garbage
He
doesn't
cook
But
he
could
Uh
no
How
do
you
know
What
do
I
always
say
Anyone
can
cook
Well
yeah
anyone
can
That
doesn't
mean
that
anyone
should
Well
that
is
not
stopping
him
See
What
is
he
doing
No
No
No
this
is
terrible
He's
ruining
the
soup
And
nobody's
noticing
It's
your

Do
something
What
can
I
do
I
am
a
figment
of

But
he's

We
got
to

that

Oui

Remy
What
are
you
waiting
for
Is
this
going
to
become
a
regular
thing
with
you
You
know
how
to
fix
it
This
is
your
chance
The

Where
is
the

Out

Move
it
garbage
boy
You
are
cooking
How
dare
you
cook
in
my
kitchen
Where
do
you
get
the
gall
They
don't
just
survive
They
discover
they
create
I
mean
just
doubled array elements size to 1024
look
at
what
they
do
with
food
GUS
TEAU
ON
TV
How
can
I
describe
it
Good
food
is
like
music
you
can
taste
color
you
can
smell
There
is
excellence
all
around
you
You
need
only
be
aware
to
stop
and
savor
it
Oh
Gusteau
was
right
Oh
mmm
yeah
Oh
amazing
Each
flavor
was
totally
unique
But
combine
one
flavor
with
another
and
something
new
was
created
So
now
I
had
a
secret
life
The
only
one
who
knew
about
it
was
Emile
Hey
Emile
Emile
I
found
a
mushroom
Come
on
you're
good
at
hiding
food
Help
me
find
a
good
place
to
put
this
He
doesn't
understand
me
but
I
can
be
myself
around
him
Why
are
you
walking
like
that
I
don't
want
to
constantly
have
to
wash
my
paws
Did
you
ever
think
about
how
we
walk
on
the
same
paws
that
we
handle
food
with
You
ever
think
about
what
we
put
into
our
mouths
All
the
time
When
I
eat
I
don't
want
to
taste
everywhere
my
paws
have
been
Well
go
ahead
But
if
Dad
sees
you
walking
like
that
he's
not
going
to
like
it
What
have
you
got
there
You
found
cheese
And
not
just
any
cheese
Tomme
de
chèvre
de
pays
That
would
go
beautifully
with
my
mushroom
And
This
rosemary
This
rosemary
with
maybe
with
a
few
drops
from
this
sweet
grass
Well
throw
it
on
the
pile
I
guess
and
then
we'll
You
know
We
don't
want
to
throw
this
in
with
the
garbage
This
is
special
But
we're
supposed
to
return
to
the
colony
before
sundown
or
you
know
Dad's
gonna
Emile
There
are
possibilities
unexplored
here
We
got
to
cook
this
Now
exactly
how
we
cook
this
is
the
real
question
Yeah
The
key
is
to
keep
turning
it
Get
the
smoky
flavor
nice
and
even
That
storm's
getting
closer
Hey
Remy
you
think
that
maybe
we
shouldn't
be
so
You
got
to
taste
this
This
is
It's
got
this
kind
of
It's
burny
melty
It's
not
really
a
smoky
taste
It's
a
certain
It's
kind
of
like
a
It's
got
like
this
"ba
boom
zap"
kind
of
taste
Don't
you
think
What
would
you
call
that
flavor
Lightning
y
Yeah
It's
lightning
y
We
got
to
do
that
again
Okay
when
the
next
storm
comes
we'll
go
up
on
the
roof
Which
means
clean
You
know
cleanliness
is
close
to
Never
mind
Move
on
Well
it
made
my
dad
proud
Now
don't
you
feel
better
Remy
You've
helped
a
noble
cause
Noble
We're
thieves
Dad
And
what
we're
stealing
is
let's
face
it
garbage
It
isn't
stealing
if
no
one
wants
it
If
no
one
wants
it
why
are
we
stealing
it
Let's
just
say
we
have
different
points
of
view
This
much
I
knew
If
you
are
what
you
eat
then
I
only
want
to
eat
the
good
stuff
But
to
my
dad
Food
is
fuel
You
get
picky
about
what
you
put
in
the
tank
your
engine
is
gonna
die
Now
shut
up
doubled array elements size to 2048
and
eat
your
garbage
Look
if
we're
going
to
be
thieves
why
not
steal
the
good
stuff
in
the
kitchen
where
nothing
is
poisoned
First
of
all
we
are
not
thieves
Secondly
stay
out
of
the
kitchen
and
away
from
the
humans
It's
dangerous
I
know
I'm
supposed
to
hate
humans
but
there's
something
about
them
What
I
say
is
true
Anyone
can
cook
But
only
the
fearless
can
be
great
Pure
poetry
But
it
was
not
to
last
Gusteau's
restaurant
lost
one
of
its
five
stars
after
a
scathing
review
by
France's
top
food
critic
Anton
Ego
It
was
a
severe
blow
to
Gusteau
and
the
brokenhearted
chef
died
shortly
afterwards
which
according
to
tradition
meant
the
loss
of
another
star
Gusteau
is
dead
Run
No
you'll
lead
her
to
the
colony

look
around
Remy
Why
do
you
wait

Well
I've

my
friends
probably
forever
How

Well
I
You
are

Why
am
I
talking

you
Well
you
just
lost
your
family
all
your
friends
You
are
lonely
Yeah
Well
you're
dead
Ah
but
that
is
no
match
for
wishful
thinking
If
you
focus
on
what
you've
left
behind
you'll
never
be
able
to
see
what
lies
ahead
Now
go
up
and
look
around
Champagne
What
are
you
doing
I'm
hungry
I
don't
know
where
I
am
and
I
don't
know
when
I'll
find
food
again
Remy
you
are
better
than
that
You
are
a
cook
A
cook
makes
A
thief
takes
You
are
not
a
thief
But
I
am
hungry
Food
will
come

Food
always
comes
to
those
who

You
know

wise
What's
this
She
left
it
for
you
I
think
she
hoped
it
would
help
me
I
know
what
this
needs
Saffron
A
little
saffron
would
make
this
Saffron
Why
do
I
get
the
feeling
it's
in
the
kitchen
It's
in
the
kitchen
Saffron
Not
good
Saffron
Don't
like
it
She's
gonna
wake
up
I've
been
down
here
a
million
times
She
turns
on
the
cooking
channel
boom
she
never
wakes
up
You've
been
here
a
million
times
I'm
telling
you
saffron
will
be
just
the
thing
Gusteau
swears
by
it
Okay
Who's
Gusteau
Just
the
greatest
chef
in
the
world
Wrote
this
cookbook
Wait
You
read
Well
not
excessively
Oh
man
Does
Dad
know
You
could
fill
a
book
a
lot
of
books
with
things
Dad
doesn't
know
And
they
have
which
is
why
I
read
Which
is
also
our
secret
I
don't
like
secrets
All
this
cooking
and
reading
and
TV
watching
while
we
read
and
cook
It's
like
you're
involving
me
in
crime
and
I
let
you
Why
do
I
let
you
What's
taking
those
kids

long
Ah
I'Aquila

Huh
Gusteau
says
it's
excellent
Good
thing
the
old
lady
is

food
love
Forget
mystique
This
is
about
your
cooking
Hey
That's
Gusteau
Emile
look
Great
cooking
is
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
Great
cooking
is
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
You
must
be
imaginative
strong
hearted
You
must
try
things
that
may
not
work
And
you
must
not
let
anyone
define
your
limits
because
of
where
you
come
from
Your
only
limit
is
your
soul
